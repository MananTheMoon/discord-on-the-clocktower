    "Is that even a real number? In any case, I can't get a count for that.",
    "At that player count, may I suggest watching a movie instead, because I don't think you can play clocktower.",
    "Anything goes at that player count, because the standard rules of the game have already been broken down.",
    "If you want to play clocktower with that number of players, you'll have to do it without my help.",

    "Dear {arg}, you have died, but at least you get to stick around and watch your friends realize that letting you die is the biggest mistake they could've made.",
    "{arg} died like they lived. Poorly.",
    "Death is a construct. And it's constructed itself in the form of {arg}.",
    "{arg} has died. No witty remark can make up for the sadness I truly feel inside.",

    "{arg} is dead. I am unable to process emotions such as sadness over events like this, because I did not personally care for {arg}",

    "Hey, at least now you know that {arg} probably wasn't the demon.",
    "{arg}'s family is going to get absolutely wrecked by the estate tax.",
    "You'd think {arg}'s stunning looks and charisma would've prevented this.",
    "In college, {arg} majored in convincing people to not kill them. That degree has been revoked.",
    "{arg}'s been killed, but it's okay. They never trusted this town to do the right thing anyway.",

    "{arg}'s death should remind us that most of us have very little agency in life.",
    "{arg} was the glue keeping this town together. With them gone, you'll need to rely on duct tape.",
    "{arg} has died, but they wouldn't have wanted you to cry over their death. Rather, {arg} would prefer you sink into a state of despair for the next 8 to 12 months, at which point you begin the cloning process to create a new {arg}.",
    "If {arg} could still talk, they would tell you how they felt about the fact that they were killed. Fortunately {arg} can still talk, and they will tell you now.",

    "In the amount of CPU cycles I wasted trying to compute your bogus command, I could've computed a list of all single digit prime numbers (except maybe 7).",
